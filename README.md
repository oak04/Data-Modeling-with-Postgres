# Sparkify

# #Project Summary
 Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their music streaming app.
 So in this project, I created a Postgres database and ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into 5 tables in the Postgres database using Python and SQL.


## Run the project

 Clone the repository
`git clone `
 Install the requirements
Start a database server
 Modify the connection strings in etl.py and create_tables.py
 Create the tables
`python create_tables.py`
 ETL
`python etl.py`
